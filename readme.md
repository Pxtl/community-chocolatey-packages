# Repo for Pxtl's Community-Contributed Chocolatey Packages

Maybe these should have been separate repos.  I don't know.  I'm new making chocolatey packages and there isn't much guidance about source control.

## Intellectual Property Note

The provided chocolatey installation packages do not include private IP, but instead download freely available software from public locations for user convenience.  The only files downloaded and hosted in this repo are icons downloaded from the respective webpages:

- the SSIS icon `./packages/standalone-ssis-devops-tools/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.ico` was downloaded from
  - https://ssis.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/ssis/sqlserverintegrationservicesprojects/4.6/1711002523930/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default
  - visible on the page https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SSIS.SqlServerIntegrationServicesProjects
