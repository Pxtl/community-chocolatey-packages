    <description>

      SSIS official description of Standalone SSIS DevOps Tools:
      
      &lt; Standalone SSIS DevOps Tools provide a set of executables to do SSIS CICD tasks. Without the
      &lt; dependency on the installation of Visual Studio or SSIS runtime, these executables can be easily integrated
      &lt; with any CICD platform. The executables provided are:

      &lt; - SSISBuild.exe: build SSIS projects in project deployment model or package deployment model.
      &lt; - SSISDeploy.exe: deploy ISPAC files to SSIS catalog, or DTSX files and their dependencies to file system.
